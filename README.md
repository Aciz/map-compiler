# id Tech 3 Map Compiler
This project aims to be an all-in app for compiling maps for games based on id Tech 3 engine. For now, the development is focused towards W:ET and q3map2. At it's current state, the project is just a modified version of [q3map2](http://q3map2.robotrenegade.com/), forked from [NetRadiant's q3map2 2.5.17n](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/netradiant/tree/225d4bba22a409bc1c375a2029d2162d336f0070).
